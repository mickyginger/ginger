# Ginger

Ginger is an attempt to build ExpressJS from scratch, just to see if I could.

There are no dependencies. It's just node.

I have a feeling that express middleware like `body-parser` will work with Ginger, but I haven't tested it yet.

My intention is to create a `req.body` as standard, without the need for a 3rd-party package. Having said that, I might never look at this again 🤷‍♀️
